<p><img src="team08Apr17/images/chocolate-fudge-cake.jpg" width="274" height="208" alt=""/></p>
<p>INGREDIENTS</p>
<ul>
  <li>310g(1 1/4 cups) no-fat Greek yoghurt</li>
  <li>200g soft silken tofu, drained</li>
  <li>70g (1.3 cup) caster sugar</li>
  <li>2 egg yolks</li>
  <li>2 tsp vanilla bean paste</li>
  <li>80g 70% cocoa dark chocoloate, melted, cooled slightly</li>
  <li>50g (1/3 cups) plain flour, sifted</li>
  <li>1 tbs self-raising flour, sifted</li>
  <li> 4 egg whites</li>
  <li>1 tbs strawberry jam (or fruit spread)</li>
  <li>1 tbs water</li>
  <li>250g punnet strawberries, halved</li>
  <li>Micro herbs, optional, to serve</li>
</ul>
<p>METHOD<br>
Step 1 <br>
Place a fine sieve over a bowl. Line the sieve with a double layer of muslin. Place the yoghurt in the centre of muslin. Bring edges together to enclose. Twist or tie with string to secure. Place in the fridge for 8 hours or overnight to drain. <br>
Step 2 <br>
Preheat oven to 160C/140C fan forced. Spray a round 20cm cake pan with oil to grease and line the base and side with baking paper. <br>
Step 3 <br>
Process tofu, sugar, egg yolks and half the vanilla in a food processor until smooth. Add the chocolate and process until smooth. Transfer to a bowl. Fold in combined flour. <br>
Step 4 <br>
Beat egg whites with electric beaters in a clean, dry bowl until soft peaks form. Use a large metal spoon to fold one-third of the egg white into chocolate mixture until just combined. Repeat, in 2 more batches, with remaining egg white. Spoon cake mixture into the prepared pan and smooth surface. Bake for 40 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Set aside in pan to cool. <br>
Step 5 <br>
Heat the jam or fruit spread, remaining vanilla and 1 tbs of the water in a non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Simmer for 1 minute. Add strawberries. Simmer for 2-3 minutes or until just softened. Cool. <br>
Step 6 <br>
Place the cake on a serving plate. Top with the yoghurt, spreading to the edges. Top with the strawberries and drizzle with syrup. Scatter with micro herbs, if using.</p>

<p>INGREDIENTS</p>
<ul>
  <li>175g butter, chilled, chopped</li>
  <li>2 cups plain flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
  <li>1/4 cup custard powder</li>
  <li>1/2 cup caster sugar</li>
  <li>1 egg</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon NESTLE BAKERS' CHOICE Cocoa</li>

  <li>icing sugar mixture, for dusting</li>
  <li>150g prepared white icing (fondant)</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon water, boiling</li>
</ul>
<p>Method<br>
  Step 1 <br>
Place butter, flour, custard powder and sugar in a food processor. Process until mixture resembles fine crumbs. Add egg and vanilla. Process until mixture just comes together. Turn onto a lightly floured surface. Divide mixture into 6 equal portions. Return 1 portion to the food processor with cocoa. Process until well combined. Shape into a disc. Wrap in plastic wrap.<br>
  Step 2 <br>
  Using pink food colouring, tint 1 remaining portion bright pink. Knead until well combined. Shape into a disc and wrap in plastic wrap. Repeat with remaining dough portions and food colourings, leaving 1 portion plain. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. <br>
  Step 3 <br>
  Preheat oven to 150C/130C fan-forced. Using 1 portion at a time, roll out dough between 2 sheets of baking paper until 5mm thick. Using cookie cutters (see Notes), cut rounds from dough, re-rolling and cutting dough scraps. Place 2cm apart on bakingpaper- lined baking trays. Using a skewer, make holes in the centre of the rounds to form button holes. Using the picture as a guide, make imprints on some of the rounds (see Claire’s tips). Refrigerate for 10 minutes or until firm. <br>
  Step 4 <br>
  Bake biscuits for 16 to 18 minutes or until cooked, but not golden. Stand on tray for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Repeat process with remaining 5 portions. <br>
  Step 5 <br>
  Dust a surface with icing sugar mixture. Knead 100g fondant until smooth. Using a rolling pin, roll fondant out between 2 sheets of baking paper until 2mm thick. Using cookie cutters, cut rounds. <br>
  Step 6 <br>
  Place remaining icing in a heatproof bowl. Add boiling water. Stir until smooth. Spoon into a snap-lock bag. Snip off 1 corner. <br>
  Step 7 <br>
  Pipe a little icing onto 1/4 of the biscuits. Top with icing rounds, pressing gently to secure. Using a skewer, make holes in the centre of icing rounds to form button holes. <br>
  Step 8 <br>
Pipe remaining icing onto some of the remaining biscuits to create patterns. Leave remaining biscuits plain. Stand iced biscuits for 1 hour to set. Transfer to a 1-litre-capacity jar with lid. Serve.</p>

Step 2 <br>
Preheat oven to 170C/150C fan-forced. Line 2 large baking trays with baking paper. Roll out dough between 2 sheets of baking paper until 5mm thick. Using a 6cm round cutter, cut rounds from dough, re-rolling and cutting trimmings. Place rounds, 2cm apart, on prepared trays. <br>
Step 3 <br>
Bake 1 tray at a time for 12 to 15 minutes or until light golden. Stand for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. <br>
Step 4 <br>
Meanwhile, dust a flat surface with extra icing sugar. Knead white icing until smooth. Knead in strawberry essence. Divide icing into 5 equal portions. Using food colouring, tint one portion pink, one portion green, one portion blue, one portion purple and remaining portion yellow. <br>
Step 5 <br>
Roll out pink icing between 2 sheets of baking paper until 3mm thick. Using a 6cm round cutter, cut 1 round from icing. Lightly brush 1 biscuit with water. Using the picture as a guide, top biscuit with icing round. Gently press to secure. Press a 4.8cm heart-shaped cutter into icing on biscuit. Using alphabet stamps, stamp messages onto biscuits.

</ul>
<p>METHOD<br>
Step 1 <br>
Sift the White Wings Premium All Purpose Plain Flour, baking powder and salt into a bowl. Use an electric mixer to beat the butter and caster sugar in a bowl for 5 mins or until pale and creamy. Beat in the vanilla and egg. Stir in the flour mixture. <br>
Step 2 <br>
Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Knead for 1 min or until smooth. Divide dough into 2 portions and shape each portion into a disc. Wrap in plastic wrap and place in the fridge for 30 mins to chill. <br>
Step 3 <br>
Preheat oven to 180C. Line 2 baking trays with baking paper. <br>
Step 4 <br>
Roll out 1 pastry disc between 2 sheets of baking paper to 5mm thickness. Use a 7cm round pastry cutter to cut 12 discs from dough, re-rolling trimmings if necessary. Place discs 3cm apart on the lined trays. Bake for 12-15 mins or until lightly golden. Set aside to cool. Repeat with remaining dough to make 24 biscuits. <br>
Step 5 <br>
Sift the icing sugar into a bowl. Add enough milk to make a thick spreadable consistency. Spoon icing over the cooled biscuits and spread towards the edges to form the melted body. <br>
Step 6 <br>
Use kitchen scissors to cut 24 small triangles from an orange snake lolly to form the noses. Gently dip the bases of the noses in icing. Attach to the sides of the marshmallows. Use the writing icing to pipe eyes and mouths onto the marshmallows. Press marshmallow heads onto iced biscuits. Use kitchen scissors to cut heads from snake lollies. Cut down the length of snakes to make two long thin pieces. Wrap around marshmallow heads to form scarves. <br>
Step 7 <br>
Place red and green M&amp;M’s Minis down the centre of the biscuits to form buttons. Use the writing icing to pipe arms on each biscuit. Store in an airtight container for up to a week.</p>
